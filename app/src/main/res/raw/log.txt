Problem: We tried to create our own card and deck classes
Solution: we realized it was easier and cleaner to use Dr. Vegdahls

Date: 11/5
Problem: we didn’t realize we were supposed to be using the game framework so we started from scratch
Solution: using slapjack as a model for our Hearts card game

Date: 11/6
Problem: When drawing human player cards on the GUI for them to see cards were not appearing.
Solution: saw Vegdahl, there was a method setting cards to null, deleted

Date: 11/10
Problem: not sure how to tell when a card has been touched
Solution: Vegdahl, creating an array of booleans in addition to card location array and the cards themselves.
Compare x,y coord of touch with if the coords are contained in the location array change the bool position to true to alert the card to move

Problem: human playing a card they didn't want
Solution: asking the user to double tap to confirm their card choice

Date: 11/17
Problem: right before alpha testing our program wasn't running/ showing GUI
Solution: Dr. Vegdahl helped us fix the GUI by telling us to have it so that the cards aren't re-drawn after every tick

Date: 11/27
Problem: Github repository wasn’t working, everything turned red and wouldn’t compile.
Solution: Dr. Vegdahl helped us with Github issues after alpha test by creating a new repository and adding us as collaborators.
We learned that we have to be careful to not push and pull a lot at the same time.

Rough date
Problem: AI can't play cards because the currentPlayer index never changes, don't know why
Solution: Dr. Vegdahl helped us see that we weren't properly initializing the GameState, now we can get the game conditions to change the player index

Rough date
Problem: BaseSuit can't be referenced, it changes every time the AI looks at it
Solution: Dr. Vegdahl gave us the idea to put it into GameState, where it can be referenced by the human player and AI players without an issue

Date: 12/5
Problem: Had trouble getting an “info” button to create a popup
Solution: Saw tutors, had to move the button png to res file even though it was an android internalized image.  Had to link with Main Activity through the xml ‘onClick'.

Date:12/5
Problem: We needed a way to announce game winner
Solution: We learned from the tutors that we can use an alert popup

Date: 12/7
Problem: Our GameState object in localGame was not initializing our players array, which caused NullPointer exceptions.
Solution: Dr. Tribelhorn told us to only reference player objects only in localGame and NOT gameState. Once we implemented this it fixed our problem.

Date: 12/8
Problem: Our code is playing the first card just fine, but it goes into a never-ending loop after that
Solution: Dr. Vegdahl found that we were returning a string in our popup that announced the winner, which made the game think it was over. We returned null.
